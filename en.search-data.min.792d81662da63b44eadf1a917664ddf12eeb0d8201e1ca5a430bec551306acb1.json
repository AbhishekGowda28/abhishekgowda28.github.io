I was a notion fanatic, had my complete life setup in notion. My daily task, bookmark of websites, TV-shows, books and much more.\nI started using notion to organize thing in my life, whatever I did, used to update that in notion. But doing this was taking lot of my time. Don\u0026rsquo;t know why I was doing that.\nThe setting up of notion with All it\u0026rsquo;s different views formulaes and things, it keeps going. But it\u0026rsquo;s takes away lot of your time doing that. While doing my notion setup\u0026rsquo;s I was in the mindset that if I just get this kind of setup I would be productive and after few daysl there will be someone in the reddit community posting there awsome setup and I wanted to try that.\nFinally I got around with setting up my workspace how I thought I wanted and for few days I obidently used it. And after that it felt it was becoming a burden that needs me to keep it up with. So I ditched notion for good, deleted all the workspace. And is not using Notion for anything.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/posts/jsx_as_template/","title":"Jsx as Template","section":"Notes","content":"JSX as a templating language #  If you are doing web development in react, you would know what JSX is. If not go look it up, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to explain. And if your using typescript in web development it\u0026rsquo;s tsx.\nThis is how a sample JSX looks like\nconst SampleJsx = () =\u0026gt; { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;SampleJSX\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ) } And this is how a regular XML looks like\n\u0026lt;parentSection\u0026gt; \u0026lt;childSection\u0026gt;This is a child content\u0026lt;/childSection\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/parentSection\u0026gt; If we remove the const, return and other language construct of javascript(or ecmaScript, if you like to call it that) this is how it would look\n\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;SampleJSX\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; But wait that\u0026rsquo;s not how a XML looks like, it always start with some wearied syntax that says what version it\u0026rsquo;s and some encoding right, something like this.\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; That\u0026rsquo;s prolog, it\u0026rsquo;s very important for xml files to include that.\nAll these are fine, but how these relates to jsx being a template language, right.\nYou see, the xml files are static or in other words if we output from the xml file it\u0026rsquo;s output is same in most situation. And if we output the jsx file, even it\u0026rsquo;s same in most situation, but that\u0026rsquo;s not what we do. We use it with javascript.\nYou see jsx already uses HTML tags, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t want us to write any fancy element and define it later. Since it uses HTML it\u0026rsquo;s definition is taken care of. What we do is write custom elements, we combine the elements provided by HTML, use javascript to provide input to it and puff, we have a jsx element with different output.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take the jsx example we defined above, and change up few things. Instead of having hardcoded SampleJSX let\u0026rsquo;s take that through a prop and call it innerDiv and enclose this within the braces {}.\nconst SampleJsx = ({ innerDiv } : prop) =\u0026gt; { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;{innerDiv}\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ) } When I use this element elsewhere, I can pass in values to the SampleJsx element by changing the value of innerDiv id  \u0026lt;SampleJsx innerDiv=\u0026quot;SampleJSX\u0026quot; /\u0026gt;\nKnow you would be thinking, \u0026ldquo;I already know all these things and I write better [J|T]SX or react component than you and wasted my 2-3 mins of my day reading your shit post in here.\u0026quot; Right, but there is more to jsx than this, but that\u0026rsquo;s for another notes. üëã üëã üèÉ\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/posts/intro/","title":"Intro","section":"Notes","content":"Let\u0026rsquo;s see what this can host #  "}]
