I was a notion fanatic, had my complete life setup in notion. My daily task, bookmark of websites, TV-shows, books and much more.\nI started using notion to organize thing in my life, whatever I did, used to update that in notion. But doing this was taking lot of my time. Don\u0026rsquo;t know why I was doing that.\nThe setting up of notion with All it\u0026rsquo;s different views formulaes and things, it keeps going. But it\u0026rsquo;s takes away lot of your time doing that. While doing my notion setup\u0026rsquo;s I was in the mindset that if I just get this kind of setup I would be productive and after few daysl there will be someone in the reddit community posting there awsome setup and I wanted to try that.\nFinally I got around with setting up my workspace how I thought I wanted and for few days I obidently used it. And after that it felt it was becoming a burden that needs me to keep it up with. So I ditched notion for good, deleted all the workspace. And is not using Notion for anything.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/posts/","title":"Notes","section":"Introduction","content":""},{"id":3,"href":"/posts/programming_lab/","title":"Programming Lab","section":"Notes","content":"\rProgramming Lab\r#\rI wanted this to reflect me as a professional, where I could attract some potential people who would pay for my work, but later thought, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do that and here it\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip;\nDISCLAIMER\r#\rNOTE : ALL THESE ARE MY OWN OPNION AND IN NO WAY IT REFLECT ANY OF MY SURROUNDING PEOPLE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MY FAMILY, FRIENDS, EMPLOYERS, EMPLOYEES or ANYONE ELSE\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what more to add in here, because in these times of CANCEL CULTURE anything you add could offend someone and you can get canceled for just being there.

If not go look it up, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to explain. And if your using typescript in web development it\u0026rsquo;s tsx.\nThis is how a sample JSX looks like\nconst SampleJsx = () =\u0026gt; { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;SampleJSX\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ) } And this is how a regular XML looks like\n\u0026lt;parentSection\u0026gt; \u0026lt;childSection\u0026gt;This is a child content\u0026lt;/childSection\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/parentSection\u0026gt; If we remove the const, return and other language construct of javascript(or ecmaScript, if you like to call it that) this is how it would look\n\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;SampleJSX\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; But wait that\u0026rsquo;s not how a XML looks like, it always start with some wearied syntax that says what version it\u0026rsquo;s and some encoding right, something like this.\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; That\u0026rsquo;s prolog, it\u0026rsquo;s very important for xml files to include that.\nAll these are fine, but how these relates to jsx being a template language, right.\nYou see, the xml files are static or in other words if we output from the xml file it\u0026rsquo;s output is same in most situation. And if we output the jsx file, even it\u0026rsquo;s same in most situation, but that\u0026rsquo;s not what we do. We use it with javascript.\nYou see jsx already uses HTML tags, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t want us to write any fancy element and define it later. Since it uses HTML it\u0026rsquo;s definition is taken care of. What we do is write custom elements, we combine the elements provided by HTML, use javascript to provide input to it and puff, we have a jsx element with different output.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take the jsx example we defined above, and change up few things. Instead of having hardcoded SampleJSX let\u0026rsquo;s take that through a prop and call it innerDiv and enclose this within the braces {}.\nconst SampleJsx = ({ innerDiv } : prop) =\u0026gt; { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;{innerDiv}\u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ) } When I use this element elsewhere, I can pass in values to the SampleJsx element by changing the value of innerDiv id \u0026lt;SampleJsx innerDiv=\u0026quot;SampleJSX\u0026quot; /\u0026gt;\nKnow you would be thinking, \u0026ldquo;I already know all these things and I write better [J|T]SX or react component than you and wasted my 2-3 mins of my day reading your shit post in here.\u0026rdquo; Right, but there is more to jsx than this, but that\u0026rsquo;s for another notes. üëã üëã üèÉ\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/","title":"Docs","section":"Introduction","content":""}]
