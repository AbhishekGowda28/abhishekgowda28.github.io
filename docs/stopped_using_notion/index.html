<p>Notion is an all in one note taking app. It started as so, but I think now it has growen more than that. I was a notion fanatic, had my complete life setup in notion. My daily task, bookmark of websites, TV-shows, books and much more.</p>
<p>I started using notion to organize thing in my life, whatever I did, used to update that in notion. But doing this was taking lot of my time. Don&rsquo;t know why I was doing that.</p>
<p>The setting up of notion with All it&rsquo;s different views formulaes and things, it keeps going. But it&rsquo;s takes away lot of your time doing that. While doing my notion setup&rsquo;s I was in the mindset that if I just get this kind of setup I would be productive and after few daysl there will be someone in the reddit community posting there awsome setup and I wanted to try that.</p>
<p>Finally I got around with setting up my workspace how I thought I wanted and for few days I obidently used it. And after that it felt it was becoming a burden that needs me to keep it up with. So I ditched notion for good, deleted all the workspace. And is not using Notion for anything.</p>
